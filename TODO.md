# TODO
## Features
- [x] Add profile import from ModHeader. Look in the "__import_examples__" folder, and then in the respective sub-folder for "ModHeader". There's an example of what the exported file from that service looks like.
- [x] Implement scrolling when dragging a header to the top or bottom so you can move it around more easily.
- [ ] i18n for all strings
- [ ] Implement filter functionality, allowing for enabling or disabling a profile depending on the url you're visiting. Preferably easy methods, like "starts with", "host equals" etc.
- [ ] Implement adding response headers, the same way we add request headers.
- [ ] Fixing undo/redo state to only track relevant changes. Including re-ordering of items.

## AI improvements
- [ ] Research better ways for AI to navigate and develop the project.
- [ ] Research any kind of specialized agents or skills that could be helpful to reference during development. Possibly chrome/web extension skills, vue3, tailwind, css etc.
